# First measures on Nakheel

In this activity, you will answer three questions from Nakheel's managers with `GROUP BY`, `WHERE` and `HAVING`.

**Time:** 10 minutes · **Data:** `nakheel.orders`, `nakheel.customers` · **Starter:** `Unsolved/nakheel_measures.sql`

For each question, write down what one row of the **result** will be before you write the query.

## Instructions

1. "How many completed orders did each channel bring in, and what were they worth?"

    Translate: completed orders, grouped by `channel`; count them and sum `order_total`.

2. "Which months of 2025 brought in more than 13,000 dinars from completed orders?"

    Translate: completed orders placed in 2025, grouped by month (`DATE_TRUNC(order_date, MONTH)`, as in activity 04), keep the months whose revenue is over 13,000.

3. "How many customers do we have in each city? Biggest city first."

    Translate: `customers`, grouped by `city` as it was typed, counted, sorted by the count.

## Check yourself

| Question | Rows returned | One value to check |
|---|---:|---|
| 1 | 2 | store: 1,763 orders, 205,338.00 |
| 2 | 4 | September 2025: 17,472.00 |
| 3 | 11 | Amman 191; one row is `NULL` |
| Bonus | 1 | 2026-08-06, 14 orders (all statuses) |

If a count differs, check the status and year in `WHERE`. Question 2 also needs the revenue threshold in `HAVING`.

## Hint

Question 2 needs a filter on rows (the year, the status) and a filter on groups (the revenue). One goes in `WHERE`, the other in `HAVING`.

## Bonus

Which single day had the most orders, counting every status? Expect one row.

Then look again at question 3. Eleven rows, but Nakheel trades in eight cities. Which rows should be the same city? In the next hour, `TRIM` and `LOWER` merge `amman` into Amman. `Al Zarqa` needs a rule you write yourself. The `NULL` row is a missing city, not a misspelling.

## Still to answer

"Which product category brings in the most revenue?" You cannot answer it yet: categories are in `products`, and amounts are in `order_items`. That needs two tables at once, which is the subject of D06.
