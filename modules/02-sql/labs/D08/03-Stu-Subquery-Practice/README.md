# Subquery practice

In this activity, you will answer four manager questions with a subquery: the products above the average price, the customers who never ordered and the products never sold (with `NOT IN`), and the name of the biggest customer.

**Time:** 12 minutes · **Data:** `nakheel.products`, `nakheel.customers`, `nakheel.orders`, `nakheel.order_items` · **Starter:** `Unsolved/subquery_practice.sql`

For every question, write the inner query first and run it on its own. Only when it gives what you expect, put it in brackets inside the outer query.

## Instructions

1. "Which products cost more than our average list price?"

    Translate: products whose `list_price` is greater than the average `list_price` of all products; most expensive first. The inner query returns one number, so `>` works.

2. "Which customers have never placed an order? This time without a join."

    Translate: customers whose `customer_id` is `NOT IN` the list of `customer_id` values in `orders`. `NOT IN` keeps a row when its value is nowhere in the list. You found the same customers on D07 with a `LEFT JOIN` in [Never ordered, never sold](../../D07/02-Stu-Never-Ordered/README.md).

3. "Which products have never been sold?"

    Translate: products whose `product_id` is `NOT IN` the list of `product_id` values in `order_items`.

4. "Who is our biggest customer by completed revenue? I want the name, not just the ID."

    Translate: the inner query finds one `customer_id`: completed orders, grouped by customer, sorted by `SUM(order_total)` from largest, first row only. The outer query looks that customer up in `customers`.

## Check yourself

| Question | Rows returned | One value to check |
|---|---:|---|
| 1 | 22 | the average list price is 20.35; P-015 Wool overcoat first, 60.00 |
| 2 | 39 | the same 39 customers as D07; C-1013 Anas Abbadi first by ID |
| 3 | 4 | P-009, P-025, P-046, P-058 |
| 4 | 1 | C-1380, Leen Najjar |

If question 4 stops with `Scalar subquery produced more than one element`, the inner query returns more than one row. Run it alone and count its rows.

## Hint

In question 4 the inner query can sort by a sum it does not show: `ORDER BY SUM(order_total) DESC`. `LIMIT 1` then keeps only the first row, so the inner query returns one value and `=` is safe. Run it alone first: you should see one `customer_id`.

## Bonus

Not required, not checked. `NOT IN` has a trap. Questions 2 and 3 work because `orders.customer_id` and `order_items.product_id` are never empty. If the list from the inner query contains a `NULL`, `NOT IN` returns no rows at all. Run these two and compare:

```sql
SELECT customer_id
FROM nakheel.customers
WHERE customer_id NOT IN ('C-1001');

SELECT customer_id
FROM nakheel.customers
WHERE customer_id NOT IN ('C-1001', NULL);
```

The first returns 499 rows. The second returns 0. `NOT IN ('C-1001', NULL)` means "not equal to `'C-1001'` and not equal to `NULL`". A comparison with `NULL` is never true (its result is unknown), so no row passes. The D07 `LEFT JOIN … IS NULL` does not have this problem, so use it when the column in the inner query can be empty.

## Check yourself: bonus

| Question | Rows returned | One value to check |
|---|---:|---|
| Bonus 1 | 499 | every customer except C-1001 |
| Bonus 2 | 0 | no rows |
