# Never ordered, never sold

In this activity, you will find the customers who have never placed an order and the products that have never been sold, using a `LEFT JOIN` and `IS NULL`.

**Time:** 10 minutes · **Data:** `nakheel.customers`, `nakheel.orders`, `nakheel.products`, `nakheel.order_items` · **Starter:** `Unsolved/never_ordered.sql`

## How the tables connect

```mermaid

    customers ||--o{ orders : "places"
    orders ||--|{ order_items : "contains"
    products ||--o{ order_items : "appears on"
    customers {
        string customer_id PK
        string customer_name
        string city
        string segment
        date signup_date
    }
    orders {
        int order_id PK
        string customer_id FK
        date order_date
        timestamp order_ts
        string channel
        string status
        float order_total
        float shipping_fee
        date delivered_date
    }
    order_items {
        int item_id PK
        int order_id FK
        string product_id FK
        int qty
        float price
    }
    products {
        string product_id PK
        string product_name
        string category
        float list_price
    }
```

Join keys: `orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id`, `order_items.order_id = orders.order_id` and `order_items.product_id = products.product_id`.

PK is the primary key: it names one row. FK is a foreign key: it points to a row in another table. The line between two tables shows the join: the end with two short bars is the "one" side, and the end that splits into a fork is the "many" side.

## Instructions

1. "Which customers have signed up but never placed an order? The marketing team wants to contact them."

    Translate: `customers LEFT JOIN orders`, keep the rows where the order side is empty.

2. "Which products have never sold? The buying team is deciding whether to stop stocking them."

    Translate: `products LEFT JOIN order_items`, keep the rows where the item side is empty.

## Check yourself

| Question | Rows returned | One value to check |
|---|---:|---|
| 1 | 39 | C-1013, Anas Abbadi, is first by ID |
| 2 | 4 | P-009, Hiking boot |

## Hint

After a `LEFT JOIN`, test a column from the right-hand table that is never empty in real rows, such as its key: `WHERE o.order_id IS NULL`.

## Bonus

How many of the never-ordered customers are in each city, as typed? Expect 9 rows.
